1. How many of each product should Dilbert pack in the container to achieve the greatest value?

Dilbert should pack 106.164383561644 Dogberts, 50 Catberts, and 132.191780821918 Ratberts.

2. What then is the value of the container's contents?
The value of the container will be 4906.16438356164.

3. What range of values could the Ratberts unit worth coefficient assume without affecting the quantity of Catberts, Dogberts, and Ratberts that Dilbert ships to Wally?
Ratberts range of worth can vary between 13.8064516129032 and 35 without affecting the quantity of any other product.

4. For a change of 1 in the container Volume, how much will the value of the objective function change?
Changes from 4906.16438356164 to 4907.2602739726 when 3200 cubic feet is changed to 3201 cubic feet.

5. What range of values could the available Time to Pack constraint assume and Dilbert remains limited by the same constraints as in the original problem?
The Time to Pack variable can range from 956.6666666666 and 1638.

6. Adjust the available Time to Pack in your model to be slightly greater than the maximum amount identified in the previous question.
Which constraints now bind the solution?
Slightly exceeding the limit will adjust to constraints to 1638 and 1671.16279069767.

Restore your model to its original values (prior to step 6). Convert it to an integer model and answer the following questions:

7. Now how many of each product should Dilbert ship?
Dilbert should ship 106 Dogberts, 51 Catberts, and 131 Ratberts.

8. What will now be the value of the container's contents?
The value of the container will now be 4901.

Print the source and objective result for each of the 3 problems (the original, step 6, integer).
Print the sensitivity result (objective and duals) for the first 2 problems.
Hand in your printed answers to the questions and indicate (label) on the printouts where you found the answers.
